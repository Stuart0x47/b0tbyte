- creator: NOBELIUM
- type: post-exploitation backdoor

- FoggyWeb is used to remotely exfiltrate the configuration database of compromised AD FS servers, decrypted token-signing certificate, and token-decryption certificate, as well as to download and execute additional components
- FoggyWeb is stored in the encrypted file Windows.Data.TimeZones.zh-PH.pri, while the malicious file version.dll can be described as its loader.
- loader is responsible for loading the encrypted FoggyWeb backdoor file and utilizing a custom Lightweight Encryption Algorithm (LEA) routine to decrypt the backdoor in memory.

## Process
1. After compromising an AD FS server, NOBELIUM was observed dropping the following two files on the system (administrative privileges are required to write these files to the  folders listed below):

    - %WinDir%\ADFS\version.dll
    - %WinDir%\SystemResources\Windows.Data.TimeZones\pris\Windows.Data.TimeZones.zh-PH.pri

2. Once the system or the AD FS service is restarted, Microsoft.IdentityServer.ServiceHost.exe loads mscoree.dll, which in turn loads mscoreei.dll. mscoreei.dll has a delay load import (Delay Import) named version.dll.
3. Once loaded, instead of loading the legitimate version.dll from the %WinDir%\System32\ folder mscoreei.dll loads the malicious version.dll planted by the attacker in %WinDir%\ADFS\ folder (referred to as DLL search order hijacking),

## Post-Compromise
- FoggyWeb setups up HTTP listeners (C2)
    - GET endpoints
        /adfs/portal/images/theme/light01/profile.webp
        /adfs/portal/images/theme/light01/background.webp
        /adfs/portal/images/theme/light01/logo.webp
    - POST endpoint
        /adfs/services/trust/2005/samlmixed/upload
